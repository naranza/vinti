# Contributing to Vinti

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!
We welcome contributions of all types, from feature implementations and bug fixes to documentation improvements.

## Workflow: Trunk-Based Development

This project follows a trunk-based development model:

* All work must branch off from the **main** branch.
* Contributions should be made via forks and Pull Requests (PRs).

## Setup

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork locally.
3. Create a feature branch from **main**.

## Development Guidelines

* Follow the coding standards and style guides used in this project (see documentation or ask if unclear).
* Keep your changes focused and atomic â€” one feature or fix per branch/PR.
* Write clear commit messages. A suggested format is:
  type(scope): short description
  Example: fix(parser): handle empty input gracefully

## Testing

* Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR.
* Add tests for any new features or bug fixes.
* Use the appropriate test framework for this project.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your feature branch to your fork.
2. Open a PR against the upstream `main` branch.
3. In the PR description, include:

   * A brief summary of the change
   * Related issue numbers (e.g., "Closes #42")
   * Any caveats, limitations, or follow-ups

## Pull Request Requirements

* Minimal and focused diff
* Clean commit history (use rebase if needed)
* All tests and linters (if applicable) must pass
* Reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer

## Reporting Issues

Before submitting a new issue:

* Search existing issues to avoid duplicates
* Include clear steps to reproduce if it's a bug
* Be descriptive and specific

# Thank You
